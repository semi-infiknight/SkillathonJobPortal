## Project Abstract

### Problem statement

In the current job and upskilling market, there are consumers and providers. Consumers include people looking for opportunities like jobs and internships while providers refer to companies that provide jobs and internships. Currently, the trust between provider and consumer entities is superficial. Furthermore, communication between the provider entities is time consuming, expensive, and even sometimes non-existent.

This communication gap leads to recruitment organizations failing to find the most appropriate talent for the roles they need, and vice-versa. Furthermore, the communication failure between recruitment companies makes it difficult, expensive, and time consuming for thorough background checks for enabling trust between the talent pool and the recruitment organizations.

### Solution

The solution is the BPP platform which will provide a medium or channel for effective communication between consumer and provider entities also where providers can verify credentials.

Using the platform, providers will be able to register their profile and create new jobs and internships. Furthermore, when an applicant makes a request to the BPP from his registered BAP, he will also provide his credentials within the request. It is assumed that these credentials are digitally available so the BPP will verify credentials.

The BPP can also issue digitally verifiable credentials to the applicant once their term is finished with the provider. This credential is a digital copy or a physical copy and cannot be tampered with.

Target Audience

The main target audience of this solution are the possible people who are searching jobs online through many online portals.

## Tech Stack

## Features and work-flows

The provider type will have their own feature list to register, login, create their services, view and perform actions on a consumer request.

When providers handle a request, they should be able to trust the consumer based on the request received. This is generally gained by thorough background checks which are time consuming and expensive. Our solution also provides the feature to gain this trust by performing verification on the consumer's credentials like verifying past experience, documents, etc. This feature is independent of the BPP and BAP platform, which can be adopted by the both for their verifications.
